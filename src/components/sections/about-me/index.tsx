              developers time. I do this by keeping an eye on the details and
              implementing best practice wherever I go to{" "}

            <h3>Goals and the future</h3>
            <p>
              Over the next few years I aim to further my work in the DevOps
              space through certification in Azure to support running multi
              cloud workloads across Azure and AWS as well as support migrations
              of workloads to Azure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the last 2 years developing workloads to run on containers
              has been a key part of my everyday work and expertise. I aim to
              further build on this skill through building out more distributed
              applications and workloads on the Kubernetes platform running in
              both AWS and Azure.
