              <p>
                Over the next few years I aim to further my work in the DevOps
                space through certification in Azure to support running multi
                cloud workloads across Azure and AWS and support migrations of
                existing cloud workloads to Azure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the last 2 years developing workloads to run on containers
                has been a key part of my everyday work and expertise. I aim to
                further build on this skill through building out more
                distributed applications and workloads on the Kubernetes
                platform running in both AWS and Azure.
